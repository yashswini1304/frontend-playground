💡 How It Works

When the page loads, the user sees a start button.

On starting, the quiz displays one question at a time with multiple answer options.

The user selects an answer, and the app checks if it’s correct.

Once all questions are answered, the final score is shown.

The user can restart the quiz to play again.
